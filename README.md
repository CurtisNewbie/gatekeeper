# gatekeeper

Simple gateway written in Go.

I was spending most of my time working with spring-related projects, e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway.  I was thinking, do I really need all these complicated stuff? I just need a gateway that validates authentication and acts like a proxy. It turns out that I don't really need all that; I can just write a simple one on my own. What a surprise :D
